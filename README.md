## Project for the Coursera Course Getting and Cleaning Data

The submissions consists of codebook.md and the file run_analysis.r that is used to tidy the data accourding to the requirements.

The data can be found at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The data contains measurements of the 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity (sampled at a constant rate of 50Hz) from the cell phones of 30 subjects performing 6 activities (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRSG,  WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). For details look at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones and the README.txt file that is given in the zip file with the data.

The requirements of the assignment to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
